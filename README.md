# shitpostmaker
make shitposts effortlessly (what a time to be alive!)

# okay, how to use?
that's actually pretty easy. just follow these steps:
1. run ```camera.py``` and let it do take photos as long as you want to record
2. run ```videomaker.py``` script. it will make a video out of your photos in a short time.
3. lastly, if you want to add a perfect-and-hard-chosen shitpost music to your recording, ```run soundadd.py```.

# but senpai? how am i even gonna run those scripts you've given to me?
okay, on windows thats pretty straightforward. download python from its website.
on linux it will probably come preinstalled. if not, it's your job installing.

# on billy g windows
double click on windows to run scripts.
# on linux
